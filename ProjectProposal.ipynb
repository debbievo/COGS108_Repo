    "The data that we are going to use is open source for people to view, but we do not have explicit permission from the WHO. There are no privacy concerns regarding our datasets as the data already follows the Safe Harbour method and only displays gender and ages by country. There may be potential biases in the dataset due to the fact that all of the data we are using is coming from the same website. It isn’t quite clear how the data has been collected, but as far as we know, there shouldn’t be any other issues in terms of data privacy since, as we have mentioned before, our data has followed the Safe Harbour method and it doesn’t consist of individual personal information. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our data is in a form of statistics collected based on countries, and the only exclusions are due to a failure (or prevention) of information provision by the country in question. For instance, the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea has not disclosed their GDP health expenditure, or WHO was not able to acquire it. Issues of this sort will simply be addressed by cleaning these null cells from the data. Overall, our topic area and the included data analysis is not problematic in terms of data privacy, but an equitable impact is possible. If we approach our dataset with a bias that less well-off countries will immediately have a worse life expectancy, for example, it may skew our collective perspective and results. Instead, a neutral and unbiased approach is absolutely necessary to minimize confounds, even unconscious ones."

    "If our analyses and hypotheses are correct, our project will provide support for the notion that a country’s increased spending and sanitation efforts toward its citizens' health can contribute to an overall higher life expectancy throughout the country. In turn, there would be more reason for a country to allocate funds for improved health infrastructure and better well-being of its people. It is already known and somewhat obvious that the provision of health and sanitation efforts lead to a better livelihood among societies, but this study would provide a better backbone of data-based, statistical support.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the event that our methods do not work, we can begin by seeking advice on a modified or different approach before returning to the drawing board. Similarly, if our hypotheses turn out false, insight can still be drawn from the study - perhaps the results prove the converse of our hypotheses, which would lead to a follow-up study or further investigation. Either way, a goal can be accomplished regardless of potential hurdles or pitfalls that lie in wait.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our methodology, the main problems that we are preparing for would be difficulties in extracting the data or interpreting it properly, but these issues can most likely be circumvented via guidance or assistance from instructors. Some potential pitfalls or confounds could rise around the amount spent by different countries and the corresponding life expectancy of the citizens. For instance, an upper limit on spending may start to surface as too much is put toward healthcare and/or sanitation efforts while other factors diminish and inadvertently (or directly) affect life expectancy. In a similar vein, we will have to keep in mind that GDP expenditure on health and sanitation is not the sole variable in dictating life expectancies among different countries. Instead, we seek to find an entry point into factors that guide healthy, long-lasting lives."
